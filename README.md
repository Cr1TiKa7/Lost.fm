# [Lost.fm](https://amythiz.github.io/Lost.fm/)
Get more search results from Last.fm 
##
For some reason [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) always returns no more than 30 results for any search query, which is really strange, since their API [has](https://www.last.fm/api/show/track.search) pages functionality, but website itself lacks it.  
  
Lost.fm was created specifically for using Last.fm for lostwave searches, hence the name, but basically it just lists every* track found on Last.fm for some search query.  
*There still a limit of 10000 tracks that cannot be bypassed (even with specifying "page=2")
